## Lesson 1: Understanding Interest

```json
{
  "introduction": "Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving. If you borrow $1,000 at 5% annual interest, you'll pay $50 per year in interest. If you save $1,000 in a high-yield account at 5%, you'll earn $50 per year. Understanding interest is critical because it either works FOR you (when saving/investing) or AGAINST you (when borrowing). Women tend to save more conservatively and miss out on compound growth—by understanding interest, you'll make smarter financial decisions.",

      "title": "Simple Interest vs Compound Interest",
      "content": "**Simple Interest** is straightforward: You earn interest only on your original amount.\n\n**Example: Sarah's $5,000 CD at 3% simple interest:**\n- Year 1: Earns $150 (3% of $5,000)\n- Year 2: Earns $150 (3% of $5,000, same amount)\n- Year 5: Earns $150 per year\n- Total earned after 5 years: $750\n\n**Compound Interest** means interest earns interest—exponential growth!\n\n**Example: Sarah's $5,000 savings account at 3% compounded annually:**\n- Year 1: Earns $150 → Balance is now $5,150\n- Year 2: Earns $154.50 (3% of $5,150, not $5,000)\n- Year 3: Earns $159.14\n- Year 5: Total = $5,796.37\n\n**The difference:** Compound Interest earned $1,046.37 vs Simple Interest's $750 = $296 MORE just by compounding!\n\n**Why this matters to women:** Most women have retirement accounts that compound over 30-40 years. That's where the real wealth building happens. Even starting small compounds significantly."

      "title": "How Interest Rates Affect Borrowing",
      "content": "When you borrow money (credit card, car loan, mortgage), the interest rate determines how much extra you pay.\n\n**Real Example: Credit Card Debt**\n\nYou charge $3,000 on a credit card at 18% APR (typical rate):\n- If you pay $100/month: Takes 45 months, costs $4,500 (you pay $1,500 in interest!)\n- If you pay $200/month: Takes 18 months, costs $3,600 (you pay $600 in interest)\n- If you pay $300/month: Takes 11 months, costs $3,300 (you pay $300 in interest)\n\n**Aha moment:** By paying an extra $100/month, you save $1,200 in interest!\n\n**Real Example: Student Loans**\n\nBorrowed $25,000 in student loans at 5% interest (federal rate):\n- 10-year repayment: Pay $264/month, total cost = $31,680 ($6,680 in interest)\n- 20-year repayment: Pay $149/month, total cost = $35,820 ($10,820 in interest)\n\nWomen earn 20% less on average, so they often carry student debt longer. Understanding interest helps you choose smarter repayment plans."

Call your bank and ask about their highest savings rate. Many women don't realize savings accounts pay different rates!"

Starting even small investments NOW compounds significantly by retirement."

    "Use the Rule of 72 to estimate how long investments take to double. At 7% return, money doubles every ~10 years.",
    "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) ≠ APY (Annual Percentage Yield). APY includes compounding and is the real rate you earn/pay.",

## Lesson 2: Saving and Investing

```json
{
  "introduction": "Saving and investing are different, and both matter. Saving = putting money aside (safety-focused). Investing = putting money to work (growth-focused). Most women tend to over-save and under-invest, which means missing out on wealth building. This lesson explains how to do both wisely.

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (Best for tax advantages!)**\n\n**401(k):** Employer retirement plan\n- What happens: You contribute pre-tax money, employer may match\n- Example: Earn $4,000/month, put 10% ($400) in 401k\n  - Your paycheck: $3,680 (you only paid tax on $3,600!)\n  - If employer matches 50%: They add $200\n  - Total growing: $600/month invested\n- Tax benefit: Grows tax-free until retirement\n- Risk: Medium (you choose investment options)\n- Access: Can't touch until 59.5 without penalty\n- For women: Ask HR if your company has 401(k). Free money (match) is available!\n\n**IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Personal retirement account\n- Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible\n- Roth IRA: Contributions not deductible, but withdrawals tax-free!\n- 2024 limit: Can contribute $7,000/year\n- For women: Roth is often better because you'll be in lower tax bracket in retirement\n\n**2. STOCKS & MUTUAL FUNDS**\n\n**Individual Stocks:** Buy ownership in companies\n- Example: Buy Apple stock at $230/share\n- Risk: High (individual company can fail)\n- Upside: If company grows, stock grows\n- Reality: 80% of women investors feel insecure picking individual stocks\n\n**Index Funds / ETFs:** Basket of many companies\n- Example: \"S&P 500 Index Fund\" = You own 500 companies\n- Risk: Lower (diversified across many companies)\n- Upside: Average 7-10% annual return historically\n- Reality: Experts recommend these for most women\n\n**Real Example: Investment Comparison**\n\n*Investor 1: Picks individual stocks*\n- Buys 5 stocks at $2,000 each\n- 2 companies fail, loses $4,000\n- 3 companies do well, gains $3,000\n- Net: Lost $1,000 (-25%)\n\n*Investor 2: Buys S&P 500 Index Fund*\n- Buys $10,000 of index fund (owns 500 companies)\n- 20-30 companies fail (absorbed by 470 winners)\n- Overall: Up about 8% (+$800)\n- Net: Gained $800 (+8%)\n\n**3. BONDS (Conservative)**\n\nYou lend money to government/corporations, they pay you interest\n- Gov't bond: Safest, earn 4-5%\n- Corporate bond: Medium risk, earn 5-6%\n- Bond ETF: Own many bonds = diversified income\n\n**For women (typically more risk-averse): 60% stocks / 40% bonds is solid**\n\n**4. REAL ESTATE**\n- Primary home: Usually good investment (builds equity)\n- Rental property: Advanced strategy (needs capital, management)\n- Real estate investment trusts (REITs): Own real estate via stock market (easy!)"
