## WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR CURRENT CONTENT

### Example: Current Budgeting Lesson
**Problem:**
> "Budgeting is the process of creating a plan for your money.
> A budget helps you track income and expenses."

**Why it fails:**
- No real examples
- No numbers
- No specific scenario
- Woman reading thinks: "I already know this. How does this help ME?"

### Example: Improved Budgeting Lesson
**Solution:**
> "Sarah earns $3,500/month. Her fixed expenses are $2,250.
> That leaves $1,250 for food, transportation, entertainment, and goals.
>
> She spent it on: $350 groceries, $200 gas, $300 dining out, $100 clothes, $100 misc.
> That's exactly $1,050.
>
> Sarah's $200 buffer is her safety net.
>
> **Your challenge:** What are YOUR fixed expenses? Do you have a buffer?"

**Why it works:**
- Real person, real numbers
- Specific scenario
- Woman can compare to own situation
- Clear action step
