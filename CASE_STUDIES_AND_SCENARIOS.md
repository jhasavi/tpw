## HOW TO USE THESE CASE STUDIES

### In Lesson Content
```
## Real Example: Sarah's Budget

Sarah is a 32-year-old graphic designer earning $65,000/year.
Here's her actual situation:

**Income:**
- Gross: $65,000/year ($5,417/month)
- After taxes: ~$4,100/month

**Fixed Expenses:** $2,500/month
- Rent: $1,200
- Car: $350
- Student loans: $300
- Insurance: $200
- Utilities: $150
- Other: $100 + $100 subscriptions

**Sarah's Challenge:** 
She has $4,100 - $2,500 = $1,600 left, but it goes to food, gas, 
and fun. Nothing left for emergency fund, investing, or debt payoff. 
Where does she find money?

**Sarah's Solution (using lesson strategies):**
1. Cut subscriptions ($100) → "I don't use 3 of them"
2. Reduce dining out ($100) → Pack lunch 2x/week
3. Find roommate? ($300) → Too much, but exploring...
4. Ask for raise ($3k/year) → Ask for promotion in 6 months

Now Sarah has: Original $1,600 + $200 cuts = $1,800
- Emergency fund: $300/month (3 years to goal)
- Debt payoff: $300/month
- Investing: $100/month

YOUR SITUATION: What does your budget look like?
```
