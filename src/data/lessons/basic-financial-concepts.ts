# Basic Financial Concepts

## 1. Lesson Purpose

This lesson gives you the **core vocabulary of money**. Once you understand these basic concepts, every other financial decision becomes clearer: budgeting, paying off debt, investing, buying a home, or planning for retirement.

For many women, money talk has been kept vague or intimidating on purpose. In Purple Wings, we remove the mystery and give you **simple, honest explanations** so you can make decisions for yourself — not just trust whoever sounds confident.

## 2. Real-World Women's Scenarios

Here are three situations where basic financial concepts matter:

- **Aisha, 36, single mom**  
  Aisha earns a steady salary but still feels like she is “bad with money.” When she lists her income, expenses, debts, and savings, she realizes her biggest issue isn’t discipline — it’s **high-interest debt** eating her cash flow.

- **Meera, 29, early-career professional**  
  Meera is finally earning more, but inflation and rent hikes make her feel stuck. Learning about **inflation and compound growth** helps her see why investing early, even small amounts, protects her future power.

- **Lina, 48, re-entering the workforce after caregiving**  
  Lina worries she is “too late.” Understanding **net worth** (not just income) helps her focus on building assets and protecting what she has, instead of feeling ashamed about past years of lower earnings.

You will use the same concepts in this lesson to look at **your own numbers**.

## 3. Key Concepts in Plain Language

### 3.1 Income

**Income** is money that comes in.

- Salary or wages
- Tips and commissions
- Side gig or freelance money
- Benefits like child support, alimony, or government benefits
- Interest or dividends from savings and investments

> Question: Is your income stable, growing, or unpredictable?

This matters because stable income supports long-term commitments (like rent or mortgage), while variable income requires extra planning.

---

### 3.2 Expenses

**Expenses** are money that goes out.

- Fixed: rent, mortgage, insurance, childcare, loan payments  
- Variable: groceries, gas, utilities, phone, internet, medical costs  
- Lifestyle: eating out, gifts, subscriptions, beauty, travel  

A simple way to think about expenses:

> Every rupee or dollar you spend says something about your **priorities today**.  
> Every rupee or dollar you save or invest says something about your **priorities tomorrow**.

In later lessons, we will sort expenses into **needs, wants, and goals**.

---

### 3.3 Assets and Liabilities

These two concepts describe what you **own** and what you **owe**.

- **Assets** = things you own that have value or can grow in value.  
  Examples:
  - Cash in bank accounts
  - Emergency fund
  - Retirement accounts
  - Investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds)
  - Home equity
  - A business you own

- **Liabilities** = what you owe to others.  
  Examples:
  - Credit card balances
  - Personal loans
  - Car loans
  - Student loans
  - Mortgage
  - Money owed to family or friends

Not all liabilities are “bad” — a reasonable mortgage or student loan can support long-term goals. But **high-interest, growing debt** (like many credit cards) is dangerous because it works against you every month.

---

### 3.4 Net Worth

**Net worth** is a simple formula:

> **Net worth = Total assets − Total liabilities**

This is not a judgment of your worth as a person.  
It is just a snapshot of your financial position today.

- Positive net worth: you own more than you owe.  
- Negative net worth: you owe more than you own (common when starting out, and fixable).

For women, net worth is especially important because:

- We often have **interruptions in income** (caregiving, illness, relocation).  
- We live longer on average, so our money needs to last more years.  
- Assets (like savings, investments, home equity) can protect us during transitions like divorce, job loss, or widowhood.

---

### 3.5 Cash Flow

**Cash flow** is about timing:

> How much money flows in versus how much flows out **each month**.

- Positive cash flow: income > expenses  
- Negative cash flow: expenses > income

Healthy cash flow gives you **choices**:
- Pay off debt faster  
- Build an emergency fund  
- Invest for future goals  

Weak cash flow makes everything harder, even if your income looks okay on paper. Later modules will help you reshape your cash flow.

---

### 3.6 Interest and Compound Interest

**Interest** is the cost of borrowing or the reward for saving.

- When you **borrow**, you pay interest.  
- When you **save or invest**, you may earn interest.

**Simple interest**: interest is calculated only on the original amount.  
**Compound interest**: interest is calculated on the original amount **plus** previous interest.

Example (simplified):

- You invest 100 each month at 6% per year for 10 years.  
- Because of compounding, your money grows faster in later years than in early years.

For women, compounding is especially powerful because:

- Even if income is lower or interrupted, **starting earlier** with small amounts can still build meaningful wealth.  
- Time can help close some of the gap created by wage inequality.

---

### 3.7 Inflation

**Inflation** means prices rise over time.  
The same basket of groceries or medical services will cost more in 5, 10, or 20 years.

If your money **never grows**, inflation quietly shrinks its power.

Inflation is why:
- Keeping all savings in a low-interest account for decades is risky.  
- Investing for long-term goals (retirement, children’s education, future housing) matters.

---

### 3.8 Risk and Return

Every financial decision has two sides:

- **Risk**: the chance that things go wrong or are different than expected.  
- **Return**: what you might gain over time.

General pattern:

- Higher potential return usually comes with higher risk.  
- Very “safe” options (like cash) often have low return and may lose ground to inflation.

Your job is not to avoid all risk. Your job is to **choose the right level of risk** for your situation, goals, and time horizon.

Women often carry risk in other parts of life (caregiving, career sacrifice), so financial risk should be thoughtful, not reckless.

## 4. Step-by-Step: See Your Own Financial Picture

Set aside 20–30 minutes for this exercise. You do not need exact numbers; rough estimates are a great start.

### Step 1: List your income

Write down monthly amounts:

- Salary or wages (after tax if easier)
- Side income
- Benefits (child support, alimony, etc.)
- Any other regular money coming in

Add them up. This is your **monthly income**.

---

### Step 2: List your regular expenses

You can do this quickly:

1. Open your banking app or recent statements.  
2. Look at the last full month.  
3. Write down:
   - Housing (rent/mortgage)
   - Utilities (electricity, gas, water, internet, phone)
   - Transportation (fuel, public transit, car payment, insurance)
   - Food (groceries, eating out)
   - Debt repayments (loans, credit cards)
   - Childcare/school costs
   - Subscriptions (streaming, apps, gym)
   - Health (meds, doctor visits, insurance)

Add them up. This is your **monthly expenses**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate your monthly cash flow

Use this simple formula:

> **Monthly cash flow = Income − Expenses**

- If positive: great! That extra amount can go toward goals.  
- If negative: don’t panic. This lesson is about awareness, not shame. Upcoming lessons will help you adjust.

---

### Step 4: List your assets and liabilities

On one page, make two columns:

- **Assets**  
  - Cash in bank accounts  
  - Emergency fund  
  - Savings and investments  
  - Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA, EPF, PPF, etc.)  
  - Property or land  
  - Business ownership

- **Liabilities**  
  - Credit card balances  
  - Personal loans  
  - Car or bike loans  
  - Student loans  
  - Mortgage  
  - Money owed to family/friends

Estimate values. Perfection is not required.

---

### Step 5: Estimate your net worth

Add up assets.  
Add up liabilities.  
Subtract:

> **Net worth = Assets − Liabilities**

Write down the number, even if it feels uncomfortable.

This is your **starting point**, not your final story.

---

## 5. Practical Tools You Can Use

You can keep this simple:

- A notebook or journal titled “My Money Map”
- A spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel, or Numbers)
- A simple budgeting app that lets you enter:
  - Income
  - Expenses
  - Debts
  - Savings/investments

The goal for this lesson is not a perfect system. The goal is **clarity**.

---

## 6. Empowerment Mindset Shift

Many women have been told:

- “You’re not good with numbers.”
- “Your husband/partner will handle the money.”
- “Talking about money is greedy or unladylike.”

Purple Wings replaces those messages with:

- You have the **right** to understand your financial life.  
- You have the **ability** to learn these concepts step by step.  
- You have the **power** to change direction at any age.

Knowing your income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and net worth is **not selfish**.  
It is an act of **self-respect and safety**.

---

## 7. Reflection Questions

You can answer these in your journal:

1. Before this lesson, how did you feel when people talked about “net worth” or “assets”? Has that feeling shifted?
2. Which part of your financial picture feels clearest right now: income, expenses, assets, or liabilities? Which feels foggiest?
3. When you think about your future self 10 years from now, what do you want your net worth and cash flow to support?
4. What messages about money did you hear growing up, especially as a girl or woman? How have those messages influenced your choices?
5. What is one small, kind thing you can say to yourself today about your relationship with money?

---

## 8. Homework (Small, Actionable Steps)

Complete these in the next 3–5 days:

1. **Write your Money Snapshot**  
   On one page, write:
   - Monthly income (total)
   - Monthly expenses (total)
   - Assets (rough total)
   - Liabilities (rough total)
   - Net worth (assets minus liabilities)

2. **Highlight one concern and one strength**  
   - Concern example: “My cash flow is negative.”  
   - Strength example: “I have no high-interest debt,” or “I already have some savings.”

3. **Choose one simple improvement**  
   For example:
   - Cancel one subscription you don’t use.
   - Move 10–20 each week into a separate savings account.
   - List your highest-interest debt in order, ready for the debt lesson.

4. **Share with a trusted person (optional)**  
   If it feels safe, share your Money Snapshot with a friend, sibling, mentor, or partner who respects your goals. Ask them to support you, not judge you.

5. **Schedule a check-in**  
   Put a 20-minute “Money Check-in” on your calendar for one week from today. In that session, you will review this snapshot and notice any changes.

Remember: this lesson is about **seeing clearly**. You do not have to fix everything today. Awareness is the first, powerful step toward independence.
