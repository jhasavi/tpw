# Understanding Federal Revenue — Taxes and Deductions

This lesson is adapted from *Hawkes Learning, Section 6.4: Federal Revenue*, rewritten to simplify the key ideas around how income tax, deductions, and federal contributions work.

## 1. What Is Federal Revenue?
Federal revenue is money the U.S. government collects mainly from **taxes** to fund public services like national defense, education, infrastructure, and healthcare.

**Fun fact:** The 16th Amendment (ratified in 1913) gave Congress the power to collect income taxes annually. 【50†source】

## 2. Gross Income vs. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Gross Income** | All earnings from wages, tips, bonuses, investments, and other sources. |
| **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** | Gross income **minus allowable adjustments**, such as student loan interest, retirement account contributions, or health savings account deposits. |

### Example
You earn **$60,000** a year and receive **$120** in bank interest.  
You also paid **$1,500** in student loan interest and contributed **$4,000** to a traditional IRA.

**Gross Income** = 60,000 + 120 = **$60,120**  
**Adjustments** = 1,500 + 4,000 = **$5,500**  
**AGI** = 60,120 − 5,500 = **$54,620**

## 3. Deductions and Taxable Income

A **deduction** reduces the income that is taxed. You can choose:
- The **Standard Deduction** (a fixed amount based on filing status), or
- **Itemized Deductions** (specific expenses such as charitable donations, mortgage interest, or medical costs).

### 2024 Standard Deduction (approximate values)
| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Single | $14,600 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $29,200 |
| Head of Household | $21,900 |

### Example
You and your spouse earn **$120,000** combined. You donate **$1,000** to charity and put **$6,000** in a retirement account.

Since the standard deduction of **$29,200** is higher than your itemized total, take the **standard deduction**.

**Taxable Income:**  
AGI = 120,000 − 6,000 = 114,000  
Taxable Income = 114,000 − 29,200 = **$84,800**

## 4. Calculating Federal Income Tax

Taxes are computed using **tax brackets** that increase with income. Each portion of income is taxed at its bracket rate.

### Example (Simplified 2024 Brackets for Married Filing Jointly)
| Taxable Income Range | Tax Rate |
|------------------------|----------|
| Up to $23,200 | 10% |
| $23,201 – $94,300 | 12% |
| $94,301 – $201,050 | 22% |
| Over $201,050 | 24%+ |

If your taxable income is **$84,800**:

- 10% on first $23,200 = $2,320  
- 12% on remaining $61,600 = $7,392  
**Total Tax = $9,712**

## 5. Refunds and Balances Owed

At the end of the year, compare **tax owed** to **taxes withheld** from your paycheck.

- If you paid **more than owed**, you get a **refund**.  
- If you paid **less**, you owe the **difference**.

**Example:**  
Total tax: $3,800  
Total withheld: $3,500  
You owe: $3,800 − $3,500 = **$300**

---

## 6. FICA Taxes — Social Security and Medicare

Besides federal income tax, your paycheck includes **FICA** (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes:

| Tax Type | Rate (Employee) | Rate (Employer) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Social Security** | 6.2% (up to $168,600 income) | 6.2% |
| **Medicare** | 1.45% (no cap) | 1.45% |

### Example
You earn $3,000 per month.

- Social Security = 3,000 × 0.062 = **$186.00**  
- Medicare = 3,000 × 0.0145 = **$43.50**  
- **Total FICA = $229.50/month**

If self-employed, you pay **both shares** (total 15.3%).

## 7. Estimating Net Pay

**Gross Pay** = $3,000  
**Federal Tax** = $300  
**FICA (Social Security + Medicare)** = $229.50  
**Net Pay** = $3,000 − (300 + 229.50) = **$2,470.50**

Your net pay is what’s left after all deductions.

## 8. Tax Deadlines & Filing Tips

- **Tax Day:** Usually **April 15** (extended only for emergencies, such as 2020’s COVID-19 delay to July 15).  
- File early to avoid identity theft.  
- Keep copies of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts for deductions.  
- Use IRS Free File or tax-prep software for quick e-filing.

## 9. Key Takeaways

- **Gross Income** includes all earnings.  
- **Adjusted Gross Income** = Gross − Adjustments.  
- **Taxable Income** = AGI − Deductions.  
- **FICA taxes** fund Social Security and Medicare.  
- Track your **withholding** to avoid surprises at tax time.
