## 🧩 Interactive Quiz Structure

### Quiz Design Philosophy

- **Immediate feedback**: Explain why answer is correct/incorrect
- **Progressive difficulty**: Adaptive based on performance
- **Scenario-based**: Real-world case studies
- **Timed practice**: Simulate exam conditions
- **Spaced repetition**: Review wrong answers later

### Quiz Types by Module

#### 1. **Knowledge Checks** (After each lesson)

- 5-10 questions
- Multiple choice and true/false
- Immediate explanation
- Must score 70% to proceed

#### 2. **Module Assessments** (End of each module)

- 20-30 questions
- Mixed difficulty
- Case study scenarios
- Minimum 75% to pass
- Certificate upon completion

#### 3. **Practice Exams** (End of each Track)

- 50-100 questions
- Timed (2-3 hours)
- Series 65/7/63 style questions
- Detailed performance analysis
- Weak area identification

#### 4. **Comprehensive Finals** (End of Phase)

- 125-150 questions
- Full exam simulation
- All topics covered
- Passing score: 72% (Series 65/7 standard)
- Retry after review

### Sample Question Formats

#### **Level 1 - Knowledge Recall**

```
Q: What is the primary function of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?

A) Regulate banking institutions
B) Protect investors and maintain fair markets
C) Set interest rates
D) Manage government debt

Correct: B
Explanation: The SEC was created to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.
```

#### **Level 2 - Application**

```
Q: An investor purchases 100 shares of stock at $50 per share. If the stock pays an annual dividend of $2 per share and increases to $55 after one year, what is the total return?

A) 4%
B) 10%
C) 14%
D) 20%

Correct: C
Explanation: Total return = (Price appreciation + Dividends) / Original investment
= ($5 + $2) / $50 = $7 / $50 = 14%
```

#### **Level 3 - Analysis & Scenario**

```
Q: A 45-year-old client has $500,000 in retirement savings, plans to retire at 65, and wants moderate growth with some income. She has high risk tolerance but needs liquidity in 2 years for a home purchase. Which allocation is MOST appropriate?

A) 80% stocks, 20% bonds
B) 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash/short-term
C) 40% stocks, 40% bonds, 20% cash/short-term
D) 100% target-date fund

Correct: C
Explanation: While her risk tolerance and time horizon suggest higher equity allocation, the near-term liquidity need (home purchase in 2 years) requires 20% in cash/short-term securities. The 40/40/20 allocation balances growth potential with liquidity needs and moderate risk profile.
