# Saving and Investing — Understanding Present Value and Annuities

This lesson is based on the Hawkes Learning *Saving and Investing (Section 6.2)* material, rewritten in a practical tone with new examples.

## 1. Present Value (PV)

The **present value** is the amount of money you need today to achieve a desired **future value (FV)** after earning interest over time.

**Formula:**  
PV = A / (1 + r/n)^(n × t)

### Example 1
You want \$200,000 in 15 years. Your account earns 4.2% APR compounded monthly.  

PV = 200,000 / (1 + 0.042/12)^(12×15) ≈ **\$110,239.87**  

You’d need to invest **\$110,240 now** to have \$200,000 in 15 years.

## 2. Annuities — Regular Deposits Toward a Goal

An **annuity** means equal deposits made at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.).

**Formula for payment (PMT):**  
PMT = FV × [(r/n) / ((1 + r/n)^(n×t) – 1)]

### Example 2
You want \$150,000 in 12 years. Your account earns 5% APR compounded monthly.  

PMT = 150,000 × (0.05/12) / ((1 + 0.05/12)^(12×12) – 1) ≈ **\$796.13**  

Deposit **\$796/month** for 12 years to reach \$150,000.  

Total deposits: 796 × 12 × 12 = \$114,624  
Interest earned: 150,000 – 114,624 = **\$35,376**

## 3. Future Value of an Annuity

If you’re already making regular deposits, you can find how much your account will be worth later.

**Formula:**  
FV = PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(n×t) – 1) / (r/n)]

### Example 3
Saving \$250 per month for 10 years at 3.8% APR compounded monthly:  

FV = 250 × ((1 + 0.038/12)^(12×10) – 1) / (0.038/12) ≈ **\$36,115.09**  

After 10 years, you’ll have about **\$36,115**, having contributed \$30,000 and earned \$6,115 in interest.

## 4. Retirement Savings (401k Example)

You and your employer each contribute \$200/month (total \$400). The plan earns 6.5% APR compounded monthly.

After 20 years:  
FV = 400 × ((1 + 0.065/12)^(12×20) – 1) / (0.065/12) ≈ **\$185,416.03**

If left invested for another 15 years without contributions:  
A = 185,416 × (1 + 0.065/12)^(12×15) ≈ **\$468,218.62**

## 5. Reading a Stock Listing

A stock chart shows key data like price, volatility, and dividends.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Ticker** | Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) |
| **Prev Close** | Previous day’s closing price |
| **Open** | Today’s opening price |
| **52-Week Range** | Highest/lowest price in the past year |
| **Dividend Yield** | Annual dividend ÷ share price |
| **Beta** | Volatility measure (1 = average) |

**Example:**  
If a stock trades at \$125 with a \$0.80 annual dividend, its yield is (0.8 / 125) = **0.64%**.

## 6. U.S. Savings Bonds (Series EE)

Series EE bonds earn low interest but are guaranteed to double after 20 years.

Example: \$500 bond at 0.2% APR, compounded twice per year.  

After 15 years:  
A = 500 × (1 + 0.002/2)^(2×15) ≈ **\$515.07**  

After 20 years, if not doubled by interest, the government adjusts its value to **\$1,000**.

## 7. Practice Problems

1. How much must you invest now to have \$75,000 in 10 years at 3.5% APR compounded quarterly?  
2. How much should you deposit monthly to reach \$60,000 in 8 years at 5% APR compounded monthly?  
3. You deposit \$100 per month for 15 years at 4.8% APR. What’s the future value and total interest?  
4. A bond earns 0.15% APR compounded semiannually. What’s the value of a \$1,000 bond after 10 years?  
5. A stock pays a \$1 dividend and trades at \$40. What’s its yield?

## 8. Key Takeaways

- **Present value** tells how much you need today for a future goal.  
- **Annuities** build savings steadily through regular deposits.  
- **Future value** shows how contributions grow with compounding.  
- **Retirement savings** benefit most from time and compounding.  
- **Stocks and bonds** offer different risk and reward profiles.
