This lesson is adapted from *Hawkes Learning, Section 6.5: Budgeting* and rewritten in a modern, practical format with new examples and clearer explanations.

## 1. What Is a Budget?

A **budget** is a financial plan that helps you track income and spending over time. Think of it not as restriction but as **a spending plan** — giving every dollar a purpose.

### The 4 Basic Steps
1. **Calculate your income** (after taxes).  
2. **List your expenses** (fixed + variable).  
3. **Subtract expenses from income.**  
4. **Adjust or allocate** what’s left toward goals, savings, or debt. 【60†source】

## 2. Everyday Spending Example

**Example:** You’re tracking monthly “small” expenses.

| Activity | Frequency | Cost Each | Monthly Total |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Coffee | 3 times/week | $3.50 | $42 |
| Lunch with friends | Weekly | $12 | $48 |
| Streaming subscriptions | 2 services | $9.99 each | $19.98 |
| Occasional gifts | 2 birthdays | $20 | $40 |

**Total:** $149.98/month → **$1,800/year**  

Small expenses can add up! Tracking them helps find easy savings.

## 3. Irregular or Periodic Expenses

If you have an expense that happens once or a few times a year, **prorate** it (spread the cost monthly).

**Example:** You owe **$1,200** in car insurance annually.  
Monthly amount to set aside = $1,200 ÷ 12 = **$100/month**.

If taxes or fees are due quarterly (every 3 months), divide by 4 for quarterly payments or by 12 for a monthly savings goal. 【60†source】

## 4. Determining Monthly Net Pay and Expenses

**Example:** You earn $40,000 per year, pay $6,000 in income taxes and $3,000 in FICA.

1. **Net annual pay:** 40,000 − 6,000 − 3,000 = **$31,000**
2. **Net monthly pay:** 31,000 ÷ 12 = **$2,583.33**
3. **List monthly expenses:**  
   - Rent: $1,000  
   - Utilities: $150  
   - Phone: $70  
   - Groceries: $300  
   - Transportation: $200  
   - Insurance: $250  
   - Loan payments: $150  
   - Internet: $60  

**Total expenses:** $2,180  
**Money left:** $2,583 − $2,180 = **$403 for savings or discretionary spending.**

## 5. Building a Simple Spreadsheet Budget

You can easily create a budget in **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, or **Numbers**.

### Example Table

| Expense | Amount |
|----------|---------|
| Rent | $1,200 |
| Gas | $50 |
| Utilities | $150 |
| Internet | $60 |
| Phone | $70 |
| Health Insurance | $350 |
| Transportation | $400 |
| Food | $450 |
| Credit Card | $100 |
| Donations | $40 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$2,870** |

**Income:** $3,400/month  
**Remaining:** $3,400 − $2,870 = **$530 left**

> ✅ Use spreadsheet formulas like `=SUM(B2:B10)` to total expenses and `=Income−Expenses` to see your remaining funds. 【60†source】

## 6. Deciding What to Do with Leftover Money

If you have money left at the end of the month, consider dividing it among:  
- **Emergency fund** (3–6 months of expenses)  
- **Retirement savings (401k/IRA)**  
- **Extra loan payments**  
- **Fun spending (guilt-free!)**  

A plan prevents money from “disappearing.”

## 7. The 50/30/20 Budgeting Rule

This method divides your take-home pay into **three categories**: 【60†source】

| Category | % of Income | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Needs** | 50% | Rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, transportation |
| **Wants** | 30% | Dining out, shopping, travel, streaming services |
| **Savings/Debt** | 20% | Emergency fund, investments, student loans |

### Example
Monthly income: $3,200  
- Needs (50%): $1,600  
- Wants (30%): $960  
- Savings/Debt (20%): $640  

If rent increases by $150, try trimming “wants” or find new income to stay balanced.

## 8. Comparing Spending Options — Example

You’re evaluating three phone plans:

| Plan | Cost | Data | Minutes | Notes |
|------|------|------|----------|-------|
| Basic | $15 | 1 GB | 2,000 | Limited features |
| Standard | $30 | 2 GB | 2,000 | Most balanced |
| Premium | $50 | Unlimited | 1,100 | Great for heavy users |

👉 Choose based on your **budget and habits** — not just the lowest price. The cheapest may limit data or coverage. 【60†source】

## 9. Analyzing Real-World Spending Trends

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, **Americans under 35** spend most on **housing, food, and transportation**, followed by personal insurance and entertainment. 【60†source】

| Category | Under 35 Avg Annual | 35–54 Avg Annual | 55+ Avg Annual |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Housing | $31,000 | $45,000 | $37,000 |
| Food | $12,500 | $18,000 | $15,000 |
| Transportation | $15,000 | $20,000 | $13,000 |
| Entertainment | $4,000 | $6,000 | $5,000 |

Younger adults’ expenses often exceed the ideal 50/30/20 split — mainly because **necessities** like rent and insurance take a larger share. 【60†source】

## 10. Final Tips for Better Budgeting

- Automate savings to make it effortless.  
- Track your **spending trends monthly**.  
- Review and adjust your budget every 3–6 months.  
- Expect change — budgets evolve as your life does.  
- Be flexible: It’s okay to shift categories as long as you stay balanced overall.
